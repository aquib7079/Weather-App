# Weather-App
This Weather Web Application fetches real-time weather data from a weather API based on the user's or inputted location. It displays current conditions, temperature, and relevant information in a clear format. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases my skills in API integration and responsive web design.
